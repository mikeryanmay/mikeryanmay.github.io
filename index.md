Welcome to my website!
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California with Carl Rothfels (Berkeley) and Bruce Rannala (Davis).
I use a combination of theory, computation, simulation, and data analysis to understand macroevolutionary processes, especially those that govern lineage diversification (speciation and extinction).

Please check out my [research page](/pages/research) for more details about what I'm up to!

Or watch recordings of my [recent conference talks](/pages/videos).
