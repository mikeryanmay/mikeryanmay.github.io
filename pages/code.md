I do most of my programming in C++ and R. 
I'm a developer on [RevBayes](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes), as well as the R packages [TESS](https://github.com/hoehna/TESS) and [RevGadgets](https://github.com/cmt2/RevGadgets).
Head over to my [GitHub](https://github.com/mikeryanmay) page for examples of my code, as well as supplementary code and data archives for my publications.

I'm developing a standard total-evidence dating RevBayes pipeline for fitting and comparing models of character evolution and lineage diversification as demonstrated in May _et al._ 2021 (Syst. Biol.).
You can find this workflow [here](https://github.com/mikeryanmay/marattiales_supplemental) (with Marattiales as a working example).

I made a little [RevBayes prior specification widget](https://mikeryanmay.shinyapps.io/plotprior/) with RevGadgets and Rshiny.
