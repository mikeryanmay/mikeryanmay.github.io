title: About me

I'm a statistical phylogeneticist, primarily focused on developing Bayesian methods to infer complex "macroevolutionary" processes from phylogenetic data.
Currently, I am exploring the impact of model specification on inferences of time-calibrated phylogenies using total-evidence dating.
