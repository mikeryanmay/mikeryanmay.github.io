I'm a statistical phylogeneticist, primarily focused on developing Bayesian methods to infer complex "macroevolutionary" processes from phylogenetic data.
Currently, I am exploring the impact of model specification on inferences of time-calibrated phylogenies using total-evidence dating.

# Lineage diversification

Mass-extinction events have profound consequences on the accumulation of lineages through time.
However, the signature of mass-extinction events on molecular phylogenies can be difficult to distinguish from other processes that may be biologically common; for example, increases in net-diversification rates (speciation minus extinction) can result in lineage-accumulation curves that are similar to those caused by mass-extinction events.
Failure to accommodate diversification-rate variation may therefore cause us to make errors in inferring the number, timing, and magnitude of mass-extinction events.
To tackle this problem, I developed a Bayesian method, CoMET, that allows us to robustly infer the impact of mass-extinction events against a background of variation in rates of speciation and extinction.
